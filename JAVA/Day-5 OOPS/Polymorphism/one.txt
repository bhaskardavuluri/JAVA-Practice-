Polymorphism
=================================================================================================
Def:-In java Polymorphism is nothing but one Acton many forms in wbich java allows objects to take
     many forms..
example:-We can take human as example for polymorphism because when we are in college we act like a 
         student and when we are in home we act like whatever we want..so this can be considered as
         the best example for Polymorphism.
Types of Polymorphism:-1)Compile Time polymorphism
                       2) Run time Polymorphism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile-time Polymorphism:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Def:-compile time polymorphism is also known as method Overloading.
Method Overloading:-same name same method same return type  but different parameters can be considered as 
                    Method Overloading.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run-time Polymorphism:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Def:-Run-time polymorphism is also known as Method Overriding.
Method Overriding:-same name same method same return type but different implementation can be considere
                   as method Overriding..

How to Achieve Polymorphism:-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we can achieve Encapsulation by using Method Overloading and Method Overriding..
